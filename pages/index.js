      <h1>Hi. I'm Mark.</h1>

      <p>
        I'm passionate about <strong>building</strong> things.
      </p>

      <p>
        By trade, I'm a full-stack software engineer, with deep knowledge in the web, with
        over a decade in the industry across a number of domains, using skills across
        Javascript / React / Ruby on Rails to deliver large scale projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside that, I worked as a visual designer, and really like to wear
        all the hats. ðŸŽ©
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm currently working with <a href="https://cogent.co/">Cogent</a>, and have worked previously
        with <a href="https://www.clover.com.au/">Clover</a>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/">The Conversation</a> and <a href="https://www.realestate.com.au/">REA</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of my day-to-day, I have a handy SaaS app
        called <Link href="/remoteretro.io"><a>RemoteRetro</a></Link> that helps (<em>mostly</em> software-development) teams
        run Agile retrospective meetings (especially when the team is remote), and I like to build wooden furniture using
        fancy joinery techniques. I'm slowly replacing all my furniture with stuff I've made.
