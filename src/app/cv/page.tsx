Carbon Plus is a team focused on growing environmental markets, &ldquo;to leave behind a planet more capable of sustaining healthy human life.&rdquo;

Leading the development of the [Platform for Land and Nature Repair](https://planr.gov.au) for the [Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/), in
collaboration with [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au). PLANR helps landowners and farmers:
- understand how parts of their land can be used for carbon abatement and biodiversity projects and the prospective outcomes
- apply for programs and certification
- list their approved offerings in various environmental units, including [ACCUs](https://cer.gov.au/schemes/australian-carbon-credit-unit-scheme/australian-carbon-credit-units), on the marketplace platform
- receive and manage enquiries from buyers

Built complex mapping interfaces displaying data layers of program eligibility, carbon sequestration potential, property boundaries, and distribution of native vegetation.
Rebuilt the drawing tool interface to improve accessibility & usability; rebuilding from [geoman](https://geoman.io/) to a custom-controlled interface, including a custom-built circle-drawn exclusion zones.

Improved the CI build: stabilising a rather unstable build process, reorganised the pipeline into groupings of roughly equal length, parallelised the [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) E2E, and reducing build times by a third (shaving off about ~10 mins).

Identified and implemented a solution saving ~35% of Azure hosting costs, by analysing usage, rearchitecting the App Service plans into environment-consistent groups, scaling instances to better match workload, and incrementally rolled out changes (starting with non-prod environments) assuring safety of change.

Cash App is a peer-to-peer payment app, enabling payments, investments in the US stock market and bitcoin, and is a subsidiary of Block. 

Worked on the team bringing Cash App globally, including the UK, Canada and Australia:
- Built an improved set of screens for Cash App users to send money cross border, including a currency selector, and a screen to confirm the exchange rate and fees. It tied into a shared interface with the remittances team for sending out-of-network.
- Prepared beta launches for Canada and Australia, with microsites for each country to sign up for a friends-and-family beta program.
- Lead work on implementing i18n ahead of globalising the app, extracting hardcoded strings in a number of component systems for both Android and iOS platforms.
- Refactored the fetching code for an exchange rates service, so all fetchers used a unified implementation, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. It also improved logging to make diganosing issues with future exchange rate providers easier.

Improved a widely-used [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) internal tool to enable proxying to production (in specific use cases to enable testing) rather then testing/staging environments only.

Built an internal tool that fetches feature flag information from [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com), and introduced a process for teams to identify and remove unused flags, and tag which teams are responsible for which flags.

Built an internal tool that generates a documentation site (hosted on Github pages) from a single command in an [Armeria](https://armeria.dev/docs/advanced-kotlin/)-driven microservice app repository. It let the engineers write markdown docs inside the repo (keeping documentation near the code), and automagically displays current protobuf definitions and API endpoints.

Rebuilt [AgSteward](https://agsteward.com.au), now the [Platform for Land and Nature Repair](https://planr.gov.au/), from a Ruby on Rails pilot app to a .Net app hosted on Azure, to meet government requirements. Enabled landowners to apply for starting [Enhancing Remnant Vegetation](https://planr.gov.au/program-info/erv) and [Carbon + Biodiversity Pilot](https://planr.gov.au/program-info/cb) projects.
