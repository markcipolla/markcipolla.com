            It&apos;s hard to find places to eat when you have dietary restrictions. Grizzly Guts came about when a friend was diagnosed with Coeliac disease, and I wanted to help us find where our
            friendship group could eat.

            Grizzly Guts began as a way to find gluten-free restaurants, cafes and shops across Australia. It will expand to include other dietary restrictions, such as vegan, vegetarian, dairy-free,
            halal, fructose-friendly, and general allergen-friendly businesses, and is a work in progress. It&apos;s built with <ExternalLink href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</ExternalLink>,{" "}
            <ExternalLink href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</ExternalLink> and{" "}
            <ExternalLink href="https://nocodb.com/">NocoDB</ExternalLink>. I&apos;ve been using it as a chance to learn Svelte, and how low-code tools like NocoDB can be used to get interfaces to
            databases up quickly and made accessible by non-engineering easily.

            <ExternalLink href="https://coeliac.org.au/">Coeliac Australia</ExternalLink> is the national body that supports Australians diagnosed with coeliac disease and associated conditions
            requiring a gluten-free diet. They have an accreditation process that restaurants, caf√©s, bakeries, butchers and food service businesses can follow.
